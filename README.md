# Python in R
Hello,

This project is my study notes and summary on how to incorporating Python in R (under Windows). 

The repository contains the deliverables of my course project (Course 80-619-11: Advanced Method on Data Mining (Fr)):

A report is given to explain the background and introduce the resources and majors approaches for using Python in R.\
A tutorial is given in the R Markdown form, exhibiting those approaches and discussing some issues that might occur.

It's feasible mainly thanks to the [reticulate]<https://github.com/rstudio/reticulate> package supported by RStudio.

I hope my report and tutorial would be helpful for anyone who wants to learn to incorporate Python in R.
